= Vext

Vext is a Clojure library for Vert.x that provides the standard Ring abstraction
we all know and love, but with the full asynchronous non-blocking benefits of
Vert.x and the underlying Netty engine.

== Status

Vext is still under active development and is ALPHA status, meaning that the API
should be considered unstable and likely to change.

== Relationship to other Clojure libraries

Vext plays a similar role to Aleph. Vert.x provides a lot of the capabilities
that are present in Aleph.
